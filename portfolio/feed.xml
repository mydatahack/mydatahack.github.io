<p>There was a log floating on the water.</p>

<p>It was burned black on one end and the other end was cut clean.</p>

<p>I grabbed it on the clean end,</p>

<p>And carefully traced the concentric rings one by one with my finger.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>A dirty yellowish brown cloth was floating on the water.</p>

<p>I swam towards the artefact to inspect it,</p>

<p>It was the dead body of a soldier.</p>

<p>My feet touched the sandy bottom and I thought to myself,</p>

<p>the shore is near.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I stood on the land, on the wet sand.</p>

<p>Charcoaled wood pieces, campfire remains,</p>

<p>I walked towards the sand dunes with tiny crabs,</p>

<p>Towards the saltbush shrub before sea level rise and storm surge.</p>

<p>In the twilight of the empire, I saw two red moons in the sky.

<br /><br /></p>

<p>The origin of pole jumping goes way back before humans invented a bridge. Our ancestors used a long stick made out of a tree to boost themselves to jump over rivers. It was an essential survival skill to use a stick to jump far over the river.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>When Z Day happens, all the bridges will be destroyed. We must do it to stop them from crossing the river. They hate water. The only means for us to cross rivers is to use a long flexible stick. You run towards the bank, stick it on the ground, and propel yourself to the other side, just like a pole jumper.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Pole jumping circles back to where it came from. We are going back to where we came from, crossing rivers by a long flexible stick.

We started drinking at 2pm in the afternoon. It was a Friday. We knocked off work early and went to a pub. We kept drinking into the night.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>After many pints of beer and tequila shots, the bartender did the last call. The pub was closing. We decided to go to another pub.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>So, we went into a pub nearby. We walked in, saw a pool table, and started playing pool. Then, I saw a brunette girl in a black dress walking towards me. We made eye contact and I immediately felt the spark. It was one of those moments that you just knew she was up for it.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>She sat on the chair by the pool table, just opposite to where I stood. She pulled up her skirt, opened her legs and started touching herself.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I was thinking to myself: ‘Wow wow wow, how this could be happening! I just hit the jackpot! She’s hot and crazy!’
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then, I suddenly realised that we were in a strip club. When we got in the club, both of us were too drunk to even realise it was a strip club. That was when I knew we went too far.

He went to rich suburbs like Toorak or South Yarra and stole dogs from rich-looking houses. He kept them in the garage at our mother’s place. Back then, we were still living with her. She’s went into the garage because she was afraid of spiders.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>He had the whole operation set up in the garage. He had dog cages stacked up like an apartment complex. He basically built a bloody dog shelter in the garage.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>After a few days, missing dog posters would usually pop up everywhere: <em>Lost Dog, my poor pooch, such an angel, with big brown eyes, and fluffy ears etc etc</em>.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then, he would dutifully bring the dog to the right owner. OK, nobody really expects to get cash rewards from returning a missing dog. For some crazy reasons, he always ended up getting paid. There was something special about him that made the rich people want to give him money. Was it because of his mischievous smile? Was it because of the way he stares at them with his puppy eyes with just the right length of time. Who knows? He somehow made money from returning dogs.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>All good things must come to an end.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>He stole a female pooch from an expensive-looking house in St Kilda. One of those houses with gargoyle status at the gate. She was a Pom, a fluffy little one. He didn’t know who the owner was. It didn’t matter. He took her back to the garage, his own private hack dog shelter. He waited for the missing dog posters to appear.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>It never came. After a week, he went back to the house to check on the owner.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>There was no house. It wasn’t there. He swore he went back to the right location. It was an empty land. Weeds growing everywhere. The gargoyles were still there at the gate. There was no mistake. The house was there where he stole the fluffy pooch.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>He went back to the garage where he kept the dog. To his surprise, she wasn’t there. He stared at the empty cage. She vanished into thin air just like the house. He swore she was there just before he left. He asked his mother if she had seen a dog that fit the description he gave her. Her answer was no.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The whole thing completely spooked him out. After that, he never stole a dog from rich people to make money.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="short-story" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My brother used to steal dogs from rich people to make money.

We probably cannot send it in a parcel from the post office. Surely, that’s not reliable. How about a reputable international courier like UPC with their black vans? Nah, probably that’s not good enough either. We’re talking about diamonds here. They are forever.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Ok, so if someone wants to ship a diamond to someone else, they would hire two men in black suits with sunglasses on. They would look like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones from Men in Black. They always work in pairs. One of them carries a suitcase and the other one does the talking. The case is tailor-made. Inside the suitcase, they cut out a hole where the diamond can fit perfectly. One suitcase per diamond. That’s right, diamonds must be carried by a person.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>They would only use first-class tickets when they fly. When they are on the road, they only use a black limo. It is equipped with a mini bar fridge filled with mini champagne bottles. They are not gonna touch the bottle because they are on duty. What a shame.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>They must be carrying guns. Of course.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>They have a rendezvous at the destination. It’s gotta be at a discreet and private location, like a room at a hotel with no sign. They meet a receiver, open the suitcase and show the gem. Note that the receiver works alone. Always. He carries a suitcase full of cash. He also carries a gun, of course. He opens his to prove that he’s got cash. After the confirmation, both parties close the cases and exchange them. During this transaction, nobody utters a word. Just a lot of nods between them.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Yes, that’s gotta be the way to mail diamonds.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>What about Opals? Ah, Australians are loose. They would probably stuff it in a parcel and mail it with Australian Post.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essay" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I sometimes wonder how diamonds get shipped from one place to another.

<br /><br /></p>

<p>I appreciate the time you took to come in for the physical performance trial for my mating partner position the other night. You were not selected to return to my apartment. I have already received applications from many qualified candidates, several of whom are taller, better-looking, and more masculine, having bigger cars, balls, and penises and greater earning capabilities, key job requirements.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Thank you for participating in the trial with me. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciate your interest in applying for my opening position. I also appreciate the time you invested in foreplay although I feel that you could have spent a little longer and made a little bit more effort.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>I wish you success in your ongoing mating partner search. Please do not consider re-applying for the position for which you are assessed as ‘not adequately qualified’. It will be a waste of time for both of us.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Sincerely,
<br /><br />
Betty</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="short-story" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Taka,]]></summary></entry></feed>
