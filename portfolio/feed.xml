He went to rich suburbs like Toorak or South Yarra and steal dogs from rich-looking houses. He kept them in the garage at our mother’s place. Back then, we were still living with her. She’s never gone into the garage because she was afraid of spiders.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He had the whole operation set up in the garage. He had dog cages stacked up like an apartment complex. He basically built a bloody dog shelter in the garage.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days, missing dog posters would usually pop up everywhere: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Dog, my poor pooch, such an angel, with big brown eyes, and fluffy ears etc etc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, he would dutifully bring the dog to the right owner. OK, nobody really expects to get monetary rewards from returning a missing dog. For some crazy reasons, he always ended up getting monetary rewards from them. There was something special about him that made the rich people want to give him money. Was it because of his mischievous smile? Was it because of the way he stares at them with his puppy eyes with just the right amount of time. Who knows? He somehow got paid from returning dogs.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All good things must come to an end.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stole a female pooch from an expensive-looking house in St Kilda. One of those houses with gargoyle status at the gate. She was a Pom, a fluffy little one. He didn’t know who the owner was. It didn’t matter. He took her back to the garage, his dog shelter. He waited for the missing dog posters to come up.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It never came. After a week, he went back to the house to check on the owners.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no house. It wasn’t there. He swore he went back to the right location. It was an empty land. Weeds growing all over th ground. The gargoyles were still there at the gate. There was no mistake. The house stood there where he stole the fluffy pooch.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went back to the garage where he kept the dog. No, she wasn’t there. An empty cage. She vanished into thin air just like the house. He swore she was there just before he left. He asked his mother if she had seen a dog that fit the description he gave her. Her answer was no.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing completely spooked him out. After that, he never stole a dog from rich people to make money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="short-story" /><summary type="html">My brother used to steal dogs from rich people to make money.

We probably cannot send it in a parcel from the post office. Surely, that’s not reliable. How about a reputable international courier like UPC with their black vans? Nah, probably that’s not good enough either. We’re talking about diamonds here. They are forever.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so if someone wants to ship a diamond to someone else, they would hire two men in black suits with sunglasses on. They would look like Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones from Men in Black. They always work in pairs. One of them carries a suitcase and the other one does the talking. The case is tailor-made. Inside the suitcase, they cut out a hole where the diamond can fit perfectly. One suitcase per diamond. That’s right, diamonds must be carried by a person.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They would only use first-class tickets when they fly. When they are on the road, they only use a black limo. You know the long one with a mini bar fridge filled with mini champagne bottles. They are not gonna touch the bottle because they are on duty. What a shame.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They must be carrying guns. Of course.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have a rendezvous at the destination. It’s gotta be at a discreet and private location, like a room at the hotel with no sign. They meet a receiver, open the suitcase and show the gem. Note that the receiver works alone. Always. He carries a suitcase full of cash. He opens his to show them he’s got what they need. After the confirmation, both parties close the cases and exchange them. During the transaction, nobody utters a word. Just a lot of nods between them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s gotta be the way to mail diamonds.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about Opals? Ah, Australians are loose. They would probably stuff it in a parcel and mail it with Australian Post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="essay" /><summary type="html">I sometimes wonder how diamonds get shipped from one place to another.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the time you took to come in for the physical performance trial for my mating partner position the other night. You were not selected to return to my apartment. I have already received applications from many qualified candidates, several of whom are taller, better-looking, more masculine, and have bigger cars, balls, penises and greater earning capabilities, key job requirements.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for participating in the trial with me. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciate your interest in applying for my opening position. I also appreciate the time you invested in foreplay although I feel that you could have spent a little longer and made a little bit more effort.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you success in your ongoing mating partner search. Please do not consider re-applying for the position for which you are assessed as ‘not adequately qualified’. It will be a waste of time for both of us.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fallen branches from His apple tree,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of wood floated from Afrika,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she won’t let me touch her –
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blank Page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same – Blank Page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I jerk off,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to start the ritual from the start again –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculation on the white blank page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she is so hard to get,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the Blue,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Moon Dust,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full Moon, New Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood Moon, Black Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wet Moon, Super Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvest Moon, Hunter Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wolf Moon, Snow Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worm Moon, Pink Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flower Moon, Honey Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buck Moon, Beaver Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total Lunar Eclipse,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark side of the Moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thou Shall Be Free,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Human Front is a military organisation to engage in an imminent space war against hostile aliens. Our primary goal is to prevent the aliens from enslaving our minds and bodies at all costs.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description of the enemy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have little knowledge regarding their biology, culture, religions, let alone their military capabilities. However, we must acknowledge that their intentions are solely hostile. Alien sightings have been reported by our comrades all across the globe throughout our history (Figure 1-1). Those aliens belong to the mother ship that is lurking close to the earth orbit (Figure 1-2). We would not yet have technology to observe its presence. However, it is apparent that the destruction of the mother ship leads to the disorganisation and disintegration of the alien species belonging to it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of the pool is the most sophisticated crystallization of human minds (Figure 2-1). We decided to harness its strength to defeat the aliens.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must build a giant cue that is as large as Australian continent. We shoot the cue up in the sky to hit the moon. The moon (cue ball) will first hit Mars (red ball) and pot it into the sun. The moon will bounce off and travel straight to the mother ship. Subsequently, the mother ship will be potted to the black hole (Figure 2-2). The atomisation of the mother ship through the black hole will cause a chain reaction of spontaneous combustions among the rest of aliens.
The necessity of potting the Mars can be explained as an intimidation tactic. Successful potting of the Mars will signal aliens our unity and determination.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the source of energy to propel the giant pool cue, we will harness the friction that occurs during masturbation. Friction causes heat and then heat generates energy (Figure 2-3). Human race must stop wasting their energy on masturbation. We must preserve the energy for the imminent launch of the giant cue. We will also build a nuclear power plant around Stephen Hawking’ penis that is connected to the launch button (Figure 2-4).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a replacement for the potted moon, we will build artificial wave machines in all the major surf beaches across the globe.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Front Rank system&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have declared in the opening statement, our sole purpose is to defend the human race from the impending alien attack. The Human Front treats everybody who is willing to sacrifice his life for our cause equally. We do not have ranks. We usually refer to each other, ‘Comrade’. Each member can call themself whatever they wish to, as in ‘General’, ‘Major’, ‘Corporal’ and so on if the title boosts the morale and commitment of the individual. However, those titles do not hold any practical purpose for their place in the rank.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Membership fee&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50 dollars of joining fee or a piece of artwork. All the membership fee goes toward the after party. Artworks will be displayed at the after party for those who wish to join the party under the influence of LSD. The Human Front does not believe in banks. The money will be safely concealed at our secret location until our victory.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closing statement&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of the human race, we have been gazing into the darkness of the endless universe and wondered if there would be any other intelligence other than us. Now, an overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that there is a hostile horde of aliens planning to take over our beautiful planet. It is high time for the human race to recognise the fact and prepare for the war. Our unity and determination can defeat the imminent alien invasion. Human race must unite against aliens.
