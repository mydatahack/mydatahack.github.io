&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the time you took to come in for the physical performance trial for my mating partner position the other night. You were not selected to return to my apartment. I have already received applications from many qualified candidates, several of whom are taller, better-looking, more masculine, and have bigger cars, balls and penises and greater earning capabilities, key job requirements.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for participating in the trial with me. I enjoyed meeting you and appreciate your interest in applying for my opening position. I also appreciate the time you invested in foreplay although I feel that you could have spent a little longer and made a little bit more effort on it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you success in your ongoing mating partner search. Please do not consider re-applying for this opening position for which you do not adequately qualify in the future. It will be a waste of time for both of us.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A piece of wood floated from Afrika,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she won’t let me touch her –
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blank Page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same – Blank Page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I jerk off,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to start the ritual from the start again –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(She know about it, she’s just lying beside me, not asleep and feels the movement of my hand, but she won’t say a word),&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ejaculation on the white blank page –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because she is so hard to get,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opening statement&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Human Front is a military organisation to engage in an imminent space war against hostile aliens. Our primary goal is to prevent the aliens from enslaving our minds and bodies at all costs.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description of the enemy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have little knowledge regarding their biology, culture, religions, let alone their military capabilities. However, we must acknowledge that their intentions are solely hostile. Alien sightings have been reported by our comrades all across the globe throughout our history (Figure 1-1). Those aliens belong to the mother ship that is lurking close to the earth orbit (Figure 1-2). We would not yet have technology to observe its presence. However, it is apparent that the destruction of the mother ship leads to the disorganisation and disintegration of the alien species belonging to it.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategy&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of the pool is the most sophisticated crystallization of human minds (Figure 2-1). We decided to harness its strength to defeat the aliens.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must build a giant cue that is as large as Australian continent. We shoot the cue up in the sky to hit the moon. The moon (cue ball) will first hit Mars (red ball) and pot it into the sun. The moon will bounce off and travel straight to the mother ship. Subsequently, the mother ship will be potted to the black hole (Figure 2-2). The atomisation of the mother ship through the black hole will cause a chain reaction of spontaneous combustions among the rest of aliens.
The necessity of potting the Mars can be explained as an intimidation tactic. Successful potting of the Mars will signal aliens our unity and determination.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the source of energy to propel the giant pool cue, we will harness the friction that occurs during masturbation. Friction causes heat and then heat generates energy (Figure 2-3). Human race must stop wasting their energy on masturbation. We must preserve the energy for the imminent launch of the giant cue. We will also build a nuclear power plant around Stephen Hawking’ penis that is connected to the launch button (Figure 2-4).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a replacement for the potted moon, we will build artificial wave machines in all the major surf beaches across the globe.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Front Rank system&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have declared in the opening statement, our sole purpose is to defend the human race from the impending alien attack. The Human Front treats everybody who is willing to sacrifice his life for our cause equally. We do not have ranks. We usually refer to each other, ‘Comrade’. Each member can call themself whatever they wish to, as in ‘General’, ‘Major’, ‘Corporal’ and so on if the title boosts the morale and commitment of the individual. However, those titles do not hold any practical purpose for their place in the rank.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Membership fee&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$50 dollars of joining fee or a piece of artwork. All the membership fee goes toward the after party. Artworks will be displayed at the after party for those who wish to join the party under the influence of LSD. The Human Front does not believe in banks. The money will be safely concealed at our secret location until our victory.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closing statement&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of the human race, we have been gazing into the darkness of the endless universe and wondered if there would be any other intelligence other than us. Now, an overwhelming amount of evidence suggests that there is a hostile horde of aliens planning to take over our beautiful planet. It is high time for the human race to recognise the fact and prepare for the war. Our unity and determination can defeat the imminent alien invasion. Human race must unite against aliens.
